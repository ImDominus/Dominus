Unlike supervised learning, unpervised learning doesn't have y.
So, using clusting algorithm
K - means Algorithm
Randomly initialize K cluster centroids u1, u2, ... uk
Repeat:
(for i = 1:m;
    c(i) := index (from 1 to K) of cluster centroid closest to x(i)
 for k = 1:K
    uk := average(mean) of points assigned to cluster k)
    
Cost Function:
J(c1, c2, ... , cm, u1, u2, ..... uk) = 1/m * âˆ‘(x(i) - uc) ** 2
uc -> cluster centroid of cluster to which example x has been assigned.

Random initialization:
takes start Uk = xk, .... etc.
But, this may fall to local optima.

Choosing number of cluster:
Elbow mathod:
plot x = number of cluster, y = cost function: then, this is decrese function
maybe suddenly decrease length is slower. That is nice for number of clusters.
