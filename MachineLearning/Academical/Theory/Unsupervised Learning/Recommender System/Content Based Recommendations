Suppose, [1, 2, 3, 4] is person (to θ1, θ2, ...), x1, x2 is correlations part(ex- romanse)
For example,
Movie	1	2	3	4	x1	 x2
a	    5	5	0	0	0.9	 0
b	    5	?	?	0	1	   0.01
c	    ?	4	0	?	0.99 0
d	    0	0	5	4	0.1	 1
e	    0	0	5	?	0	   0.9
Then, θ1 = [0, 5, 0] (or [0, 4.75, 0])
After, Using Linear Regression.
