Gradient checking will assure that back propagation works as intended.
with very small ϵ, we can take
(d/dΘ)J(Θ) = (J(Θ + ϵ) - J(Θ - ϵ)) / 2 * ϵ
with multiple theta matrices,
(d/dΘk)J(Θ) = (J(Θ1, Θ2, ...., Θk + ϵ, ..... , Θn) - J(Θ1, Θ2, ...., Θk - ϵ, ..... , Θn)) / (2 * ϵ)

Once you have verified once that your backpropagation algorithm is correct, you don't need to compute gradApprox again.
The code to compute gradApprox can be very slow.
