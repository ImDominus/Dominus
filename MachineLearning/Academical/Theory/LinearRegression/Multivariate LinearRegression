Multivariate Linear Regression means hypothesis that
h(x) = a0 + a1x1 + a2x2 + .... + anxn.
(ex) homeprices depends on not only square feet, but also floor, when built... etc.

using the matrix(vector) -> [a0 a1 a2 ... an][1 x1 x2 ... xn]^t = h(x)

Gradient Descent ->
xj := xj - alpha * 1/m * sum(h(xk) - yk) * xk
