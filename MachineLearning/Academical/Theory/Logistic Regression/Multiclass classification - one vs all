To predict weather. We must treats 2 or more weathers.
Then, we can use one vs all (or one vs rest).
Suppose there are class 1, 2, 3.
compare class1 vs class (2, 3) (treats class 2, 3 equal.) - takes h1(x)
compare class2 vs class (1, 3) (treats class 1, 3 equal.) - takes h2(x)
compare class3 vs class (1, 2) (treats class 1, 2 equal.) - takes h3(x)
On a new input x, to make a prediction, pick the x -> max(hi(x))
