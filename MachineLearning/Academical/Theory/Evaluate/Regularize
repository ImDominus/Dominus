Using Regularize Factor λ

1. Create a list of lambdas (i.e. λ∈{0,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,0.16,0.32,0.64,1.28,2.56,5.12,10.24});
2. Create a set of models with different degrees or any other variants.
3. Iterate through the λs and for each λ go through all the models to learn some Θ.
4. Compute the cross validation error using the learned Θ (computed with λ) on the JCV(Θ) "without regularization or λ = 0".
5. Select the best combo that produces the lowest error on the cross validation set.
6. Using the best combo Θ and λ, apply it on Jtest(Θ) to see if it has a good generalization of the problem.
