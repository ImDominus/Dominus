One way to break down our dataset into the three sets is:
Training set: 60%
Cross validation set: 20%
Test set: 20%

We can now calculate three separate error values for the three different sets using the following method:
Optimize the parameters in Θ using the training set for each polynomial degree.
Find the polynomial degree d with the least error using the cross validation set.
Estimate the generalization error using the test set with 
Jtest(Θ(d)), (d = theta from polynomial with lower error);
This way, the degree of the polynomial d has not been trained using the test set.
