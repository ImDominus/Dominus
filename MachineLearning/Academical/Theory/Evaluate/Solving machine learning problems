The recommended approach to solving machine learning problems is to:
1. Start with a simple algorithm, implement it quickly, and test it early on your cross validation data.
2. Plot learning curves to decide if more data, more features, etc. are likely to help.
3. Manually examine the errors on examples in the cross validation set and try to spot a trend where most of the errors were made.
