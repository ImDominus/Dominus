- We need to distinguish whether bias or variance is the problem contributing to bad predictions.
- High bias is underfitting and high variance is overfitting.
- Ideally, we need to find a golden mean between these two.

High bias (underfitting)
both Jtrain(Θ) and JCV(Θ) will be high.
Also, JCV(Θ)≈Jtrain(Θ).

High variance (overfitting)
Jtrain(Θ) will be low and JCV(Θ) will be much greater than Jtrain(Θ).
